      <description>Project description This research resulted from my time with the Bahama Oriole Project, a collaboration between the Omland Lab of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the Bahamas National Trust. The Bahama Oriole is a critically endangered songbird endemic to Andros island. Known as a brood parasite, the shiny cowbird lays its eggs in oriole nests to be raised by the oriole parents. To ensure parasitism success, cowbirds peck and kill existing oriole eggs.</description>

      <description>Project description This project was in partnership with Benjamin Franklin High School in Baltimore, MD. The goal was to analyze patterns between income, and generated waste and display them in an artistic and readable infographic. We sourced data from GRID - Arendale, BNIA (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance), and ACS (American Community Survey). To create the infographic, we used ArcMap and Adobe Illustrator software. We found that higher income neighborhoods are producing more trash than lower income neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>Project description This project analyzes the relationship between beautification of spaces and public cleanliness. We sourced data from BNAI (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance), OpenBaltimoe, and BOPA (Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts). To create the infographic, we used ArcMap and Adobe Illustrator software. We found that low-income neighborhoods habe more art murals but also more reports of dirty alleys. If given the resources, further research into this topic may reveal more obvious connections or patterns.</description>
