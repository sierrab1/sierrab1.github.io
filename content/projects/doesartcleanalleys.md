## Project Description

This project analyzes the relationship between beautification of spaces and public cleanliness. We sourced data from BNAI (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance), OpenBaltimoe, and BOPA (Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts). To create the infographic, we used ArcMap and Adobe Illustrator software. We found that low-income neighborhoods habe more art murals but also more reports of dirty alleys. If given the resources, further research into this topic may reveal more obvious connections or patterns.
