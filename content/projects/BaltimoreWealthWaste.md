## Project Description

This project was in partnership with Benjamin Franklin High School in Baltimore, MD. The goal was to analyze patterns between income, and generated waste and display them in an artistic and readable infographic. We sourced data from GRID - Arendale, BNIA (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance), and ACS (American Community Survey). To create the infographic, we used ArcMap and Adobe Illustrator software. We found that higher income neighborhoods are producing more trash than lower income neighborhoods. Unfortunately, much of this trash is incinerated via the Wheelabrator Incinerator in the low income area of Westport. These findings were presented to city leaders to inspire change in the way we handle trash, especially in low income communities.
