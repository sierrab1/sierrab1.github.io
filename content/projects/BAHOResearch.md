## Project description

This research resulted from my time with the Bahama Oriole Project, a collaboration between the Omland Lab of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the Bahamas National Trust. The Bahama Oriole is a critically endangered songbird endemic to Andros island. Known as a brood parasite, the shiny cowbird lays its eggs in oriole nests to be raised by the oriole parents. To ensure parasitism success, cowbirds peck and kill existing oriole eggs. Our goal was to rigorously document the severity of the threat cowbirds pose for the Bahama Oriole. Using a wireless nest-monitoring camera, we monitored oriole nests in two main habitat types including developed areas and undeveloped forest during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We found evidence of cowbird parasitism in Bahama Oriole nests. Using a chi-squared test, we compared nests found in both habitat types. We found that the rate of cowbird parasitism was significantly greater in developed areas near settlements and agricultural land than in undeveloped forest. These results suggest cowbird parasitism is a significant threat to orioles in developed areas. This project was funded by NSF.
