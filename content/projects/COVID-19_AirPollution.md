## Project Description

These mapping products display atmospheric pollution over NYC in its relation to COVID-19's impact on human lifestyle and environmental health. One map series shows the change in atmospheric NO2 concentrations, a common air pollutant emmitted from the combustion of fossil fuels over a crucial time period in which COVID-19 spread across the United States. The other map shows all US states that have issued stay-at-home directives as of April 19, 2020. 

New York is one of the states that has issued a stay-at-home directive. Similar patterns of NO2 air pollution may be present over the big cities of some of the other states with stay-at-home directives. It is interesting to note that pollution decreases throughout most of the time series, until the end where it spikes. More research would be needed to determien the reason behind this pattern.

 The mapping was completed with the use of Microsoft Excel, QGIS, the qgis2web plugin, the Leaflet Time Slider plug-in, and ArcMap.
