## Project description

These mapping products display several variables in their relation to COVID-19's impact on human health and lifestyle. One map series shows the change in atmospheric NO2 concentrations, a common air pollutant emmitted from the combustion of fossil fuels over a crucial time period in which COVID-19 spread across the United States. The other map series shows changes in air traffic by means of flight routes over the same period of time. The third variable is a map series showing when US states issued stay-at-home directives consistent with the timeframe of the other variables. The mapping will be completed with the use of R and RStudio, and ArcMap.
