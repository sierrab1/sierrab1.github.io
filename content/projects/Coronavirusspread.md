## Project description

This research will focus on displaying the spread of the highly-contagious COVID-19 throught the world. To accomplish this, I created a time-series of density maps that show the density of coronavirus cases globally. The timescale I use is every two to three days from  01/22/2020 - 02/17/2020. This timeseries was created with data from Johns Hopkins Github repository, using QGIS and GIMP software. Click the link below to view my project.
