## Project Description

This leaflet webpage was created for an advanced GIS class using QGIS software and the qgis2webmap plug-in. The map shows Twitter tweets out of a week in March during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I chose to compare tweets about COVID19 and tweets about hiking, as many people are spending time outside because it is a safer activity that allows people to get out of their houses during the social distancing restrictions. On the state level, I compared the percentage of tweets about hiking and tweets about COVID19 per state. The gradient color scheme shows that dark green states are tweeting more about hiking than COVID19 and dark brown states are tweeting more about COVID19 than hiking.
